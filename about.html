            <h3>The UN's Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.
                They address the global challenges we face, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation,

                <strong>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL #7 :</strong> <br/> </p>
            <p class="ingress"> <em>"Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern
                energy for all."</em> <br />The lack of affordable and clean energy and climate change goes hand in hand.
                For many decades, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas have been the major sources of electricity production.
                Burning carbon fuels like these,  produce large amounts of greenhouse gases which is the cause of climate change
                and have harmful impacts on people's well-being and the environment.
                <br /><br />
            <p class="tekst">
                Nearly 9 out of 10 people today have access to electricity but reaching that one last part,
                which consists of approximately 789 million around the world, will require highly increased efforts.
                <br /><br />
                Without electricity, women and girls have to spend hours fetching water, many school children
                cannot do homework at night and people struggle to run competitive businesses. Slow progress towards clean cooking
                solutions is a global concern and is affecting both human health and the environment. Nearly a third of the world´s
                population, mostly children and women, will continue to be exposed to harmful household air pollution.
                <br />
                Energy services are key to preventing disease and fighting pandemics.
                From powering healthcare facilities and supplying clean water for essential hygiene to enabling communications
                and IT services that connect people while maintaining social distance and quarantine. Without energy,
                the ongoing pandemic, regarding Covid-19 would be an even bigger challenge than it already is. additionally,
                without energy, clinics cannot store important vaccines, which is a huge problem especially now regarding the
                covid 19 vaccine, that is hopefully on its way.
                <br /><br />
                This is a huge problem that affects everyone, not just the “few” without electricity.
                The rapidly rising of global energy use can lead to countries not being able to power their economies without
                a stable electricity supply.
                Which makes it even more important that everyone who can, contributes to solving this challenge.
                There are many solutions to solve this exact challenge on different levels in society, and little
                things can make an even bigger impact than you know.</p>

            <p class="ingress">
                <em>DWME</em> is a brand but also a long term campaign. It is created to target gen z, and based upon “the waste of energy”,
                originally referring to wasting time, effort or action. But the deeper meaning is also to target SDG 7 and make
                gen z aware of the energy consumption and how it is affecting the world now and for the longer term in the future.
                The goal of the solution is to engage gen z in climate action, specifically targeted on energy around the world.
                <br /><br />
                Our solution answers the challenges by:<br />
            <p>
            <ul class=" liste">
            <li>   Encouraging the younger generation to take action and care about how their energy is consumed, produced and priced.</li>
            <li>   Spread awareness about energy consumption and production around the world.</li>
            <li>   Providing small and simple tips and tricks to reduce the use of energy while still being realistic and fun.</li>
            <li>   Giving gen z the opportunity to take action have their voices heard.</li>
            <li>   Encouraging generation z to reduce their use of energy.</li>
                </ul>
                <br /><br />
            <p class="tekst">
                Our solution is made for everyone but is focused on getting the newer generations involved, as it is their
                future that is at stake. We want to make their voices heard, as many of them already have shown big interest in
                making the world a better place.
                <br /><br />
                We wanted to make solving a serious problem, more fun and enjoyable for everyone!
                <br /><br />
                Buttons you can get to wear on the clothes with the text “don’t waste my energy”. To put focus on the problem,
                and show that one must take responsibility.
                <br />
                DWMY is inspired by SDG 7

                <br /><br />
                The main goal for our challenges and social media content, as well as the whole campaign, is to inspire and motivate
                generation z to think about how they choose to use their energy and care about how it is produced in addition to where
                it comes from and how it is affecting the environment.
