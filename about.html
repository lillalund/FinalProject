                SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL #7</a>  – "ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SUSTAINABLE
                AND MODERN ENERGY FOR ALL."</p> <b></b>

            <p class="tekst"> The lack of affordable and clean energy and climate change goes hand in hand.
                For many decades, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas have been the major sources of electricity production.
                Burning carbon fuels like these,  produce large amounts of greenhouse gases which is the cause of climate change
                and have harmful impacts on people's well-being and the environment.
                <br /><br />
                Nearly 9 out of 10 people today have access to electricity but reaching that one last part,
                which consists of approximately 789 million around the world, will require highly increased efforts.
                <br /><br />
                Without electricity, women and girls have to spend hours fetching water, many school children
                cannot do homework at night and people struggle to run competitive businesses. Slow progress towards clean cooking
                solutions is a global concern and is affecting both human health and the environment. Nearly a third of the world´s
                population, mostly children and women, will continue to be exposed to harmful household air pollution.
                <br /><br />
                Energy services are key to preventing disease and fighting pandemics.
                From powering healthcare facilities and supplying clean water for essential hygiene to enabling communications
                and IT services that connect people while maintaining social distance and quarantine. Without energy,
                the ongoing pandemic, regarding Covid-19 would be an even bigger challenge than it already is. additionally,
                without energy, clinics cannot store important vaccines, which is a huge problem especially now regarding the
                covid 19 vaccine, that is hopefully on its way.
                <br /><br />
                This is a huge problem that affects everyone, not just the “few” without electricity.
                The rapidly rising of global energy use can lead to countries not being able to power their economies without
                a stable electricity supply.
                Which makes it even more important that everyone who can, contributes to solving this challenge.
                There are many solutions to solve this exact challenge on different levels in society, and little
                things can make an even bigger impact than you know.</p>
